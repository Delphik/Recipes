Refreshing Bedtime Tea

## Ingredients
----
* 2 parts chamomile
* 1 part hops

### Optional Ingrediends

* Stevia

    I use 1/2tsp stevia for every 1.75L of tea

* Citrus Juice 
    
    I like lime, orange, or grapefruit juice. Will make ice cubes out of the latter two in the summer.
    

## Steps
----
1. Add chamomile and hop flowers to food processor in the desired ratio. Chop finely and mix well.

2. Brew tea with boiling water. 

    Because both teas are flowers it can be steeped many hours. I make mine in the afternoon and let it steep a few hour and chill it for the evening.

3. Drink hot, or chill and serve iced.

4. Add juice or sweeteners as desired.

Note: Mildly inebriating. Chamomile contains flavanoids such as apignen that have been theorized to be mild agonists of benzodiazepine receptors. Hops contains some mild cannabinoids. Very useful drink when detoxing from harder substances.
