# Fancy Sauerkraut

## Ingredients
----
* 1 purple cabbage
* 1 green cabbage
* 2-3 tbsp caraway seeds
* 2-3 tbsp juniper berries
* 2% salt by weight (sea or kosher not iodized)

## Equipment
* Large mixing vessel (weight while empty first so you can find the exact weight of the cabbage later)
* Kitchen Scale
* Fermentation crock
    
    My setup is

    * Wide mouth mason laters
    * Glass fermentation weights
    * Silicone Nipple Style Lid (I don't like the full airlocks that keep out all air) 



## Steps
----
1. Cut off bottom of cabbages and peel off the first few layers of outer leaves. Wash and set aside the most structurally sound for use later.
2. Quarter cabbages and remove any large solid chunks of the core. Slice into thin 1-2mm strips. Then cut the strips shorter horizontally. (I've used either a deli slicer or a large knife. Lately, I've been leaning towards the knife for less cleanup, but the slicer is useful for precision).
3. Add cabbage, caraway seeds, and juniper berries to bowl and weigh
4. Measure out 2% salt by weight and mix in slowly and thoroughly.
5. Let sit 30 minutes or so to let the cabbage sweat, then pack tightly into fermentation vessels. Leave 1-2 inches at the top for expansion. 
6. Press down until everything is completely submerged. The salinity of the brine stops bad bacteria from growing, but anything above water level will spoil.
7. Cut the outer leaf to the size of the jar and then put over top to prevent loose bits from floating up, then top with glass weight. Be sure to press on the weight to submerge it.
8. Cover and let ferment for 1-3 depending on taste. The longer the more sour. 1 week for more sweet. Then refrigerate to stop fermentation. Throw out if any signs of mold appear.
